NOTE: THIS FRAMEWORK IS NOT STILL SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.
      (However, you can still give it a try, it may suit your needs).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This framework is a very young project, started on 12/16/2010 because of the
lack of spring-alike frameworks for php.

Performance *is* a concern, but not now, because the framework is still in
development.
