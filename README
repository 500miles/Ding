NOTE: THIS FRAMEWORK IS NOT YET SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.
      (However, you can still give it a try, it may suit your needs).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This framework is a very young project, started on 12/16/2010 because of the
lack of spring-alike frameworks for php.

Performance *is* a concern, but not now, because the framework is still in
development. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see example.php for a very basic example of use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes about the source:

* There is no official release yet! So expect changes and be patience, the
work will get done. Also, performance will eventually be taken care of.

* If you're wondering why the first comment of each source file is repeated,
it's because they're actually 2 different comments: one for the file, and one
for the class.
