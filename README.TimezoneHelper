The Timezone Helper has been deprecated in favor of using "php." kind of 
properties. So you should remove the use of TimezoneHelper and add a user
property "php.date.timezone" to the user properties used by the container. This
replaces the use of the Timezone helper (see docs/examples/PhpProperties).
